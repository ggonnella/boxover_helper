An helper method for "Boxover 2.1" (boxover.swazz.org) in form of Rails plugin.

Note: I am not related to the development of boxover, which itself does not 
seem to be in active development (last update was in 2006). Boxover 
has a forum for bug reports, suggestions, etc at http://boxover.swazz.org/forum/

According to the answer to: http://boxover.swazz.org/forum/license-question-t243-1.html
its license can be considered to be a GPL. However I did not include it in this 
repository, so:

(1) Dowload the last version of boxover.js from http://boxover.swazz.org 
    and install it in the public/javascripts 

(2) Add <%= javascript_include_tag("boxover.js") -%> to your layout.

(3) Define in your stylesheet the classes boxover-body and boxover-header.

(4) Use the boxover helper to add tooltips using the title tag. 
    (see lib/helpers/boxover_helper.rb)

e.g. 
    
    image_tag "source", :title => boxover("body", "header", 
                                          :fade => true, 
                                          :delay => 0.5)
                                          
The helper is MIT-Licensed
