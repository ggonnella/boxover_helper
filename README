An helper method for "Boxover 2.1" (boxover.swazz.org) in form of Rails plugin.

Note: I am not related to the development of boxover, which itself does not 
seem to be in active development (last update was in 2006). Boxover 
has a forum for bug reports, suggestions, etc at http://boxover.swazz.org/forum/

Installation
============

Boxover is GPL-Licensed(*) and is *not* included it in this repository, so:

(0) Be sure you agree with the GPL terms, such as the obligation of releasing 
    your software also under GPL, otherwise contact the boxover author.  

(1) Dowload the last version of boxover.js from http://boxover.swazz.org 
    and install it in the public/javascripts directory.

(2) Add <%= javascript_include_tag("boxover.js") -%> to your layout.

(3) Define in your stylesheet the classes boxover-body and boxover-header.

(4) Use the boxover helper to add tooltips using the title tag. 
    (see lib/helpers/boxover_helper.rb)

(5) Feel free to define other default values in the plugin "boxover_helper.rb".

Example Usage
============= 
    
    image_tag "source", :title => boxover("body", "header", 
                                          :fade => true, 
                                          :delay => 0.5)

License terms
=============

Double license: MIT/GPL.
                                          
If you release your software and use boxover in it, probably 
the whole application is to be released under GPL. In that 
case you can consider this plugin as under the same 
GPL license as boxover.
